Do you love this day?

Tell me about it.

The wether is not that good. Dirty air, jammy traffic, endless work without meaning. I was late again as before. But I cooked myself breakfast, put up the bed. Cleaned my face before going out. I asked myself weather I loved this day or not. I swear I would love everyday in the rest of my living life. Living is just a maricle itself indeed. How would you treat such a maricle.

Of course I love this day. I will treat it as treasure. So that I can rebuild what I've destroied.
